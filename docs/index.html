<div style="text-align: center;">Vampire Killer is an action platformer game from the Castlevania series created by Konami. In this single-player game, you control Simon Belmont through the different levels of Dracula's castle in order to defeat Lord Dracula and bring peace to Transylvania once again. This horizontal 2D game is divided into 18 stages, in which the player will have to progress fighting various enemies with one weapon, the Vampire killer whip. Once we reach the end of the final stage, there is a boss fight in which we must fight Lord Dracula, the final boss. To reach the end, the player will have to find gather master keys in order to progress through the levels. Said master keys are well hidden in different castle rooms, but luckily there are more keys hidden around the castle, which open treasure chests that contain boost objects that can help the player. These boost objects can also be obtained from several merchants the player will find along the way, or hidden behind breakable walls.</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">We have tried to recreate a bit of the MSX2 (1987) version including the entrance of the castle and the second level, the laboratory. In this tribute the objective is to beat the second level of the game and face its main boss Medussa to finish the game and reach the end of the story.</div>
